Module 2 Challenge


## Overview of Project: Background and Purpose
Steve's parents want to invest in the stock market, specifically the Daqo stock. Steve has stock market data for a set of stocks for the years 2017 and 2018. He wants to analyze the data to be able to advise his parents on their investment. He wants to advise them based on the total volume (shares traded throughout the year, measures stock activity) and yearly return (percentage difference in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year). These analyses are to be carried out using VBA, a programming language that allows tasksâ€™ automation within Excel. 

## 2. Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock
